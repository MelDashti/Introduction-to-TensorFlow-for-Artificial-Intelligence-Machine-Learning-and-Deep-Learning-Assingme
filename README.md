# Introduction To TensorFlow 

In this repository, I have included every assignment I completed for the following two courses:
- Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. (4 weeks)
- Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow. (4 weeks)

# What I learnt

- Coded a neural network that learned the linear relationship between two variables.
- Implemented a callback that gives you more control over the training loop for your model.
- Implemented a convolutional neural network to assist you in the image classification task
- Implemented a CNN to assist you in the classification task for complex images.
- Implemented a convolutional neural network that classifies images of cats and dogs, along with the helper functions needed to pre-process the images.
- Implemented a convolutional neural network that classifies images of cats and dogs, along with the helper functions needed to pre-process the images.
- Implemented a convolutional neural network that leverages a pre-trained network to help you solve the problem of classifying humans from horses.
- Implemented a convolutional neural network that is able to perform multi-class classification tasks
